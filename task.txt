 * ## Stupid ##
 *
 * There's a Lithuanian/Russian card game called 'Stupid'.
 *
 * It has these (simplified) rules:
 *
 * Suites in ascending order: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades.
 * Card ranks in ascending order: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
 *
 * Cards are ordered by their rank and then their suite.
 *
 * One suite is called the trump suite. Any trump card is always higher than
 * any non-trump card.
 *
 * The trump suite is represented as the first line in data file by a letter:
 * H|D|C|S.
 *
 * Two players get their cards which are represented by a line in the file:
 * ST D2 CJ HQ DA | H2 D3 C4 S5 H6 D7 C8 S9
 *
 * First player starts as offense. Offense always starts.
 *
 * 1) He plays smallest non-trump card. If he does not have non-trump card,
 * he plays smallest trump card then.
 * 2) If defense has cards of the same rank, he plays smallest of them
 * and passes the turn to offense. This can only be done if offense has enough
 * cards to defend all of them. Roles of the attacker/defender switch then.
 * 3) Whenever there is no card to be passed, defender must use
 * smallest non-trump cards that are bigger than the each card on the table
 * to cover them, starting with the smallest uncovered cards currently on
 * table. Each card that is being used to cover a card needs to be of the same suite as
 * the card that is being covered. If he doesn't have a non-trump card to cover any card, he
 * can use a trump card to do that. If he doesn't have any card to cover current
 * card, he shouldn't play any more cards in this turn.
 * 4) Attacker then can add more cards that are of the same rank that
 * currently exist on the table for defender to current. Maximum number of
 * non-covered cards on the table cannot exceed defenders current hand size.
 * If such scenario arises, attacker then plays the smallest card from their
 * hand.
 * 5a) If all cards are covered - defender wins this round, cards are
 * discarded and defense becomes offense for the next turn.
 * 5b) If not all cards are covered - go to 3). If defender can't cover all cards
 * it loses the round and takes all cards to his hand. It's offense turn.
 *
 * Repeat this until one player does not have cards in his hand after a turn.
 * That player wins.
 *
 * For each given line, print 0 if there is a tie (both players have no cards
 * in their hands), 1 if p1 wins, 2 if p2 wins.
